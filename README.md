# SurgiSafe
SurgiSafe uses temperature, moisture, and pH sensors to detect infections, sending real-time alerts for quick action.

## Overview
This project focused on developing an innovative wearable device that monitors wounds by detecting moisture, temperature, and pH levels. Our primary objective was the early detection of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) and prompt alerts for patients. By continuously monitoring wounds, this device aims to enable early detection of conditions that could lead to severe infections.

## Background
The skin microbiome plays a crucial role in health, but when harmful bacteria like MRSA enter the bloodstream, they can affect vital organs such as the lungs and kidneys. Sepsis is a severe condition that can result from these infections and is often resistant to treatment, making it a significant health concern.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Detect moisture, temperature, and pH levels of wounds.
- **Wearable Design:** Attach the device comfortably to an arm or leg.
- **Data Visualization:** Provide insights into wound conditions through a user-friendly interface.


## Background
The skin microbiome plays a crucial role in health, but when harmful bacteria like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enter the bloodstream, they can affect vital organs such as the lungs and kidneys. Sepsis can result from these infections and is often resistant to treatment, making it a significant health concern.
